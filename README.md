#### Running MiME

**STEP 1: Installation**  

1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install). We use Python 2.7, TensorFlow 1.12. 

2. If you plan to use GPU computation, install [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

3. Download/clone the MiME code
